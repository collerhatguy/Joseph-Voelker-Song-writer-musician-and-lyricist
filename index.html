          Hello, my name is Joseph Yoo. I create music, using various key
          elements of noises and sounds to produce feelings that even words
          cannot equate to. My main program that I work with is FL Studio to
          help make said sounds and convert them into emotion. I hope you like
          my works and if you made it up to this far, thank you for stopping by.
          🙂 \ Joseph Yoo 𝒥𝓂𝓎
